#INTRO TO PYTHON

#1 - The Computational Model

#Input - Computation - Output
#Input/Output - Some kind of information being processed.
#Since this is a language, we need some syntax to represent that.
#Computers 'read' (so to speak) from top to bottom, left to right, BEDMAS

#2 - Data, Variables, and their Types
#'Primitive' types - numbers, string, list

#3 - Print and other Functions
#The same as a mathematical function - takes an input, produces a value
#The idea of repeated/redundant code, code that is "used"/"called" multiple times

#EXAMPLE
#Given any x, make it seem as though ainsley is saying x
#I.e. x='blah' -> output "Ainsley says: 'blah'"

#4 -
